title: My year in review
---
Last year I wrote about [Losing your imagination]({{< relref "post/losing-your-imagination.md" >}}) and what I was going to do about it. I've actually done most of those things except maybe writing more blogposts. I did read a lot compared to the many years before that and I'm eager to share my year in books from Goodreads.

Thanks to [Caverns and Creatures][cavernsandcreatures], [Magic 2.0][magic20], [Jurassic Park][jurassicpark], [Ready Player One][readyplayerone] and maybe even [Harry Potter][harrypotter] I'm reading a lot more and loving it. It is still hard to find books that really interest me, but I can still fall back on the classics if I've got nothing left to read.

The [Critical failures I, II, III and IV][cavernsandcreatures] books sparked my interest to try out a Dungeons and Dragons game and other tabletop games.
